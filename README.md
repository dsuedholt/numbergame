Numbergame
==========

A simple numbergame that keeps you occupied for a while. You start with a 3 by 9 grid of the numbers from 1 to 9. Numbers that are adjacent to each other (also over line breaks, or alreay crossed numbers) or above each other can be "crossed out" pairwise, if they're equal or add up to 10.

If you can't make anymore moves, the game is expanded by simply enumerating all the numbers you didn't cross yet and appending them to the board. The goal is to get rid of all numbers!
